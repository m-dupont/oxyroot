oxyroot
=======

Another attempt to make library reading of `.root` binary files which are commonly used in particle physics

# Inspiration

To make this library :

- inspiration taken from [groot](https://github.com/go-hep/hep/tree/main/groot) for reading root file, even the code
  organisation
- inspiration taken from [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5) to provide branch interface (for reading basket
  buffer)
